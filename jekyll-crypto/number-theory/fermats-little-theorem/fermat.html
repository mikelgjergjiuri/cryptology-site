      Fermat's little theorem states that for a prime number \(p\), and any integer \(a\)
      $$a^p \equiv a \mod{p}$$
      Dividing both sides by \(a\) gives us
      $$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod{p}$$
      
      Why this is important.
      Fermat's little theorem allows us to drastically speed up computation time on large exponents where applicable.
      An example of which is shown below.
      $$561^{996001} \equiv X \mod{997}$$
      Even using an efficient method for computing large exponents such as the binary method still requires a lot of work to solve for \(X\). 
      But using the theorem, we know that we can drastically reduce the exponent by dividing our exponent by \((p-1)\), where p is 997 for this equation.
      Doing so we are able to rewrite the equation as
      $$561^{996*1000 + 1} \equiv X \mod{997}$$
      Further reducing our problem we can rewrite this as
      $$561^{1}*561^{996*1000} \equiv X \mod{997}$$
      Now we can exploit Fermat's little theorem by realizing the \(561^{996*1000} \equiv 1\) and our problem becomes
      $$561 \equiv X \mod{997}$$
      Now it is obvious to see that \(X \equiv 561\).
