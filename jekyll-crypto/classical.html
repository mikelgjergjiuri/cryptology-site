title: Classical Introduction

    <td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" height="8" width="752"> 

      <p class="style8">Classical cryptography is the best starting point for
      learning cryptosystems without prior knowledge of cryptography and high
      level mathematics.&nbsp; Here we will selectively review classical
      cryptosystems. By classical cryptography we mean the cryptosystems are
      pencil-and-paper based and used until the middle of twentieth century. We
      have included shift, affine, simple substitution, transposition, Hill and
      Vigen\E8re ciphers. We have included extensive looks at each of these&nbsp;
      cryptosystems, touching on categories such as a basic description and
      history of the cipher, the advantages and disadvantages of using the
      cipher, and examples to demonstrate how the encryption and decryption
      works for each type.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style8">Along with the written elements, we have also included
      interactive demonstrations of the cryptosystem. The JavaScript and Java
      Applet demos
      should help exemplify the advantages and disadvantages of each cipher.
