      <p class="style12">Vigenere Cipher Cryptanalysis</p>
      <p class="style8">The Vigenere Cipher initially seems very secure, however
      it can be broken fairly easily once the length of the keyword is known. If
      you know that the length of the keyword is n, you can break the ciphertext
      into n cosets and attack the cipher using frequency analysis if the
      ciphertext sample is long enough. This page will look at two methods to
      determine the length of the keyword, the Friedman and Kasiski tests.</p>

            <p class="style8">Finding the Incidence of Coincidence for a sample
            of ciphertext can indicate whether or not a polyaphabetic
            substitution has been used to encipher a message. The Incidence of
            Coincidence is the probablility that two randomly selected letters
            are the same. Ordinary English has an incidence of coincidence of
            0.065. If a sample of text has an incidence of coincidence close to
            this number it is likely to be a monoalphabetic substitution, if it
            is larger then 0.0385 and less then 0.065 the text was most likely
            enciphered using a polyalphabetic cipher like the Vigenere cipher.
            The formula for finding the incidence of coincidence is:<br>

            <p class="style8">where n<sub>0</sub>, n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>,
            <b>...</b>, n<sub>24</sub>, n<sub>25</sub> are the respective counts
            of letters A,B,C,...,Y,Z in the sample of ciphertext and n=n<sub>0</sub>
            + n<sub>1</sub> + n<sub>2</sub> + <b>...</b> + n<sub>24</sub> + n<sub>25</sub>
            (the total number of letters in the ciphertext).<br>

      <p class="style9">Kasisiki Text</p>
      <p class="style8">The Kasiski Test uses the occasional aligning of groups
      of letters with the keyword to determine the length of the keyword. This
      will produce repeated groups of letters in the ciphertext. By counting the
      number of letters between the beginnings of these repeated groups of
      letters and finding a number which is the multiple of those distances, we
      can estimate the length of the keyword.<br>

        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p class="style8">The second group of repeated letters IVE occurs 12
      letters after the first. The third group of letters appears 6 letters
      after the first. Since both of these numbers are multiples of 6, this
      suggests that the length of the keyword is 6.
