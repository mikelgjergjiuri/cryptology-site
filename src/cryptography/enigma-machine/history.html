<p class="style12">History</p>

<p class="style8">In the First World War, cryptanalysts
had upper hand over the cryptographers. After the war, cryptographers
started to use technology by focusing their attention on the mechanization
of secrecy rather then relying on pencil and paper ciphers. One such
example is the Enigma machine: It was the first electro-mechanical machine
to be used for encrypting and decrypting messages. Below we present a
brief history of Enigma machine, collected from <a href="links.htm">[3]</a>.</p>

<p class="style8">

In 1918, Arthur Scherbius patented Enigma. By
1925, Scherbius started mass production of the Enigma machine for German
military and government organizations. Once the German military started
using Enigma, the Allied nations could no longer decrypt intercepted
German messages and were losing hope of ever breaking the Enigma code. But
in 1931 the French government received two documents related to Enigma.
The French government passed this information to Poland. Knowing the way
in which the Enigma machine worked and the way the Germans used the
message keys, Marian
Rejewski, a Polish cryptanalyst, mathematically determined the wiring of
the Enigma's rotors. In 1939, Poland gave the British and French all the
information they had related to the Enigma machine and two spare Enigma
replicas. The British government formed a new codebreaking organization
named the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park,
Buckinghamshire. The scientists and mathematicians at Bletchley Park
learned the details of the Enigma machine and mastered the Polish
techniques to break the Enigma. They also developed their own techniques
to break Enigma. Alan Turing developed a machine, called Bombe, which
exploited the cribs, checking rotor and plugboard setting to reveled the
keys. Even with the use of the Bombe machine, the cryptanalyst at
Bletchley Park had to do a lot of guesswork before checking for keys. The
Polish fear of war, espionage, and the intelligent work of both Polish and
British cryptanalysis lead to breaking the Enigma code which was an
important factor in Allies victory in World War II.
