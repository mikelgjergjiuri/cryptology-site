<p>A common analogy used to describe modular arithmetic is the 12 hour clock. When we reach 12:00, we do not move to 13:00, instead we wrap back around to 1:00. This is the same idea as modular arithmetic.</p>

<p>In modular arithmetic, we are left with the remainder from dividing any equation or number by our modulus.</p>

<p>A simple example can be seen in the equivalence below.</p>

\[19 \equiv 3  \mod{8}\]

<p>This is true because 19 divided twice 8 leaves a remainder of 3.</p>

<p>The same is true for equations in modular arithmetic. Some examples are shown below.</p>

\[2*4 \equiv 2 \mod{3}\]

\[2+5 \equiv 1 \mod{3}\]

<p>More abstractly, all numbers can be written in the form</p>

\[a = kn + b\]

<p>where \(a\) is any number, \(k\) is the number of times n can be divided out of \(a\), and \(b\) is the remainder.
So writing the equation \(a \equiv b \mod{n}\) is saying that both \(a\) and \(b\) have the same remainder after being divided by \(n\).</p>
