      <p style="text-align:justify" class="style8"><a href="intro.htm">Cryptology</a>
      is the science
      of coding and decoding secret messages. It is divided into <a href="intro.htm">cryptography</a>,
      which concerns designing cryptosystems, and <a href="intro.htm">cryptanalysis</a>,
      which is concerned with <i>breaking</i> cryptosystems.&nbsp;<o:p>

      <p class="style8">The word cryptology has its origin in ancient Greek and is made up of two components:
      kryptos, which means
      hidden, and logos which means word. Cryptology is believed to
      be as old as writing, and sign language could be considered the earliest
      form of cryptology. From the start of civilization to the advent of mass
      electronic communication, cryptology was mainlyused to safeguard military
      and diplomatic communications. Since then it has also become part of
      common man’s communication as more and more people are turning to
      electronic communication like e-mail. For example, in the past, cryptology
      was used by the military during wartime to make sure that the strategies were not
      leaked to&nbsp; opponents, but today we send encrypted e-mails to our
      buddies to make sure that they are not read by our parents.<o:p>

      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify" class="style8">Cryptography deals with developing
      <a href="intro.htm">cryptosystems</a>,
      which can be used to covert the messages from unintended readers. But it
      is in the nature of human beings to keep trying to know the secrets of
      others. This gave rise to the fascinating science of <a href="intro.htm">cryptanalysis</a>.
      <a href="intro.htm">Cryptanalysts</a>&nbsp; try to break cryptosystems by reading
      messages that are not
      intended for them. Since cryptography is used in a wide variety areas
      including simple e-mail, highly important and secretive military communication, and
      in e-commerce, there is a lot of gain for cryptanalysts if they break a
      cryptosystem. History has proven that cryptology is a never-ending
      struggle between cryptographers and cryptanalysts.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="style8">Cryptology is not just the science of secret
      communication but, as
      believed by many, is itself a secret science. As cryptography plays an
      important role in military communication, many cryptosystems that are more
      powerful them the ones in use today could be classified secret by the governments
      around the world.&nbsp;<o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="style8">Cryptography
      is not only used to safeguard a message in transit but can also be used to
      safeguard information residing in a computer system. For example files and
      databases can be encrypted to make sure that they are not ready by some
      one who hacked into the system. Cryptography can also be used to
      authenticate and authorize users for a single system or a network.
      <p class="style8">In this website we present some of the cryptosystems, which have been
      and/or are being widely used. For every cryptosystem we have give a brief
      history, in depth explanation with example and Java Script/Java Applet
      Interactive demo. To use this website, you website should be java enabled and
      support flash. If your browser is not support flash then you
