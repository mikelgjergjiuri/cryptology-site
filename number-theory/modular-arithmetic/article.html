		The most common example used to describe modular arithmetic is the 12 hour clock. When we reach 12:00 on a clock, we do not move to 13:00, instead we wrap back around to 1:00. This is the same idea for modular arithmetic.
		In modular arithmetic, we are left with the remainder from dividing any equation or number by our modulus.
		A simple example can be seen in the equivalence below.
		$$19 \equiv 3  \mod{8}$$
		This is true because 19 is divided twice by 8 with a remainder of 3, making them equivalent.
		The same is true for equations in modular arithmetic. Some examples are shown below.
		$$3*3 \equiv 3 \mod{3}$$
		$$3+3 \equiv 3 \mod{3}$$
		More abstractly, this is true because all numbers can be written in the form
		$$a = kn + b$$
		where a is any number, k is the number of times n can be divided from a, and b is the remainder.
		So writing the equation $$a \equiv b \mod{n}$$ is saying that both \(a\) and \(b\) have the same remainder after being divided by \(n\).
